## About Me
I'm currently a Computer Engineering bachelor's student at Shahid Beheshti University. I have tried many different fields in the last three and a half last years, from developing Websites and Applications to even trying a hand in Digital Marketing and Search Engine Optimization. But I am still trying to discover the best path for the rest of my life. I am recently interested in Machine Learning and operating with Data. Maybe this one is the last adventure!
