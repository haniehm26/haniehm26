# :ocean:Honio
Some years ago, I was wrongly called Honio instead of Hanieh. It was just a funny mistake because of the name of Ponyo which is an Anime. Since that day, I've chosen Honio as my nickname. Fun fact: I hate Animes ðŸ˜„
# ðŸŒ±About Me
I'm currently a Computer Engineering bachelor's student at Shahid Beheshti University with a high spirit in learning new materials, interested in Machine Learning and Analyzing Data. Before coming into the ML world, I was adventuring in many various fields to find my future path. My journey started as a Java Programmer, continued as a Back-End Developer, and it was going to end as a Digital Marketer.
