# :ocean:Honio
Some years ago, one of my friends wrongly called me Honio instead of Hanieh. It was just a funny mistake because of the name of Ponyo (it is an Anime). From that day, I've chosen Honio as my nickname.
## ðŸŒ±About Me
I'm currently a Computer Engineering bachelor's student at Shahid Beheshti University. I have tried many different fields in the last three and a half years, from developing Websites and Applications to even trying a hand in Digital Marketing and Search Engine Optimization. But I am recently interested in Machine Learning and operating with Data. Maybe this one is the last adventure!
